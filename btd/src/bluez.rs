//! The radio. BlueZ via `bluetoothd`'s D-Bus API, Linux only.
//!
//! Everything here is plumbing between BlueZ and [`crate::session`]'s two channels. No decision
//! about the robot is taken in this file, which is the point: the logic that could be wrong is
//! the logic that is tested, and this is the part that needs a radio.
//!
//! It uses `bluer`'s **callback model**, and the alternative was tried on hardware and does not
//! work. `bluer`'s IO model answers BlueZ's `WriteValue` and `StartNotify` with `NotSupported` —
//! it serves only the `AcquireWrite`/`AcquireNotify` fd paths — and a CoreBluetooth central drove
//! the ordinary methods. The result was a robot that advertised, accepted a connection, accepted a
//! subscription, accepted a write, and delivered none of it to this file: no `central connected`
//! line, no pairing prompt, and a client timing out against a service that was working.
//!
//! The IO model was chosen for a benefit that turns out not to exist. It reports
//! `device_address()` on both halves, which looked necessary for pairing a subscription to the
//! session that should feed it — but `bluer` holds **one** `CharacteristicNotifyState` per
//! characteristic, so there is only ever one notification session to pair with. One central at a
//! time is a property of the stack, not a shortcut taken here.
//!
//! So: one session for the service's lifetime, one notify pump, and a write callback that pushes
//! bytes into it.
//!
//! **Untested against hardware.** It type-checks for aarch64 and has never met a real central.
//! Treat what follows as intent until someone connects a phone.
